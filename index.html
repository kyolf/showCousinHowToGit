    <h1>Steps in starting a new repository</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Open your terminal and change the path to the directory you want to start a repository</li>
      <li>Write the command 'git init' to initialize the repository</li>
      <li>Write the command 'git remote add origin repo-link' 
        (Connect the local repo to github or bitbucket)</li>
      <li>Create files or make a change in file and save it</li>
      <li>Write 'git status' to check if you added files (it's red if you didn't) </li>
      <li>Write the command 'git add filename.ext' (to add each file singlehandlely) 
          or 'git add .' (to add all files that were changed)</li>
      <li>Write 'git status' to check if you added files (it's green if you did) </li>
      <li>Write the command 'git commit -m "Message"' to save the 
          changes to the local repository</li>
      <li>Write 'git status' to check if you commited the files (the file should not show)</li>
      <li>Write the command 'git push -u origin master'
          (-u tells git that when you do git push it will do git push origin master for you)</li>
      <li>Check if there are any code changes in your Github or Bitbucket</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Steps in starting from an existing repository</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Open your terminal and change the path to the directory you want to start a repository</li>
      <li>Write the command 'git clone repo-link'
          (This copies all the files and folders in that repository 
          and place it into the current folder)</li>
      <li>Repeat steps 4 - 11 from Steps in starting a repository
        anytime you create or make a change to a file</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Steps in pushing into the repository (Github or Bitbucket)</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Repeat steps 4 - 11 from Steps in starting a repository
       anytime you create or make a change to a file</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Steps in pulling from repository (Github or Bitbucket)</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>See if your collaborator make any changes in your Github. 
          If they did, do the below step.</li>
      <li>Write the command 'git pull origin master' or 
          'git pull' if you did 'git push -u origin master' before 'git pull' </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>How to work with multiple collaborators</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>If you are admin or the repository host, invite the collaborators through settings</li>
      <li>Open your terminal and change the path to the directory where you started your repository</li>
      <li>Create branches (a path that copies where you have in the 
          current repository over to another version)
          by writing the command 'git checkout -b branchName'
          (-b means to create a branch
           checkout means to go to that branch)
           <br>
          <b>branchName can be any name (best practice is to name it based on feature)</b></li>
      <li>Repeat steps 4 - 11 from Steps in starting a repository if you make any changes</li>
      <li>Once you are finish with a component or feature in this branch,
          you can copy when you have in this branch to the master branch (the final copy of your code)</li>
      <li>Write the command 'git checkout origin master' in order to go to the master branch</li>
      <li>Write the command 'git merge origin branchName' in order to go to get what you from that branch
          and overwrite the one in master.</li>
      <li>Once that is completed, do a git push</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Git Commands</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>git add .  -  
          Adds all the files that you changed into a list of files 
          that you will save into the local repository</li>
      <li>git add path-to-the-file/file.ext  -  
          Add that file to list of files
          that you will save into the local repository</li>    
      <li>git add remote origin repo-link  -  
          Connects your local repository to the online repository</li>
      <li>git checkout name  -  
          Depending on what you put in the name part, it can go to another branch 
          or a previous saved point/commit</li>
      <li>git checkout -b name  -  
          adding a -b will create a new branch and then makes you go to that branch</li>
      <li>git commit -m "Message"  -  
          Saves the files you changed into the local repository</li>
      <li>git init  -  
          Creates a local repository</li>
      <li>git merge origin branchName  -  
          Overwrites the current branch you are in with the branch you put as branchName</li>
      <li>git pull origin master  -  
          Pulls all the changes that were made by a fellow collaborator
          and places those changes into the current local repository</li>
      <li>git push -u origin master  -  
          -u sets origin master as the point where you will push to
          <br>git push pushes everything commit you made in the local repository 
          to the online repository</li>
      <li>git status  -  
          Checks if you add or committed your files yet</li>
    </ul>
